## Why Starting Hands Matter

With four hole cards, PLO hands vary widely in coordination and nuttiness. Good preflop discipline saves big swings later.

## Practical Categories (No-Room Cheatsheet)

Stronger (open/raise in most positions):

- Double-suited connected broadways (e.g., A-K-Q-J ds)
- Double-suited high rundowns (e.g., K-Q-J-T ds)
- A-A-x-x with connectivity and suits

Playable (consider position/opponents):

- Single-suited rundowns (e.g., Q-J-T-9 ss)
- A-K-Q-x with suit + connectivity
- Paired with connectivity (e.g., T-T-9-8 ds)

Avoid (dominated too often):

- Rainbow, unconnected, gappy hands (e.g., A-T-6-2 r)
- Small pairs without support (e.g., 4-4-9-2 r)
- Double-paired rainbows without connectivity
