    'A quick overview of applying GTO concepts to PLO and how PLOScope can help.',
};

PLO GTO concepts differ from NLHE due to four-card combinations and multi-board equities. In this primer, we
outline key ideas and demonstrate how to explore them inside PLOScope:

1. Hand class distributions vs. single hand strength
2. Two-board equity paths
3. Opponent range sensitivity

We will continue publishing short guides that map these concepts to product features.
