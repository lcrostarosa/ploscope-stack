## Why SPR Matters

Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR) frames how easily stacks go in by the river. Lower SPR favors high-equity, robust hands; higher SPR rewards positional play and disguised nuttiness.

## Practical Uses

- Preflop raise sizing to shape postflop SPR
- Commitment thresholds for common classes (e.g., strong wraps + redraws)
- When to avoid bloating pots with marginal holdings

### Practice

- Test different preflop sizings and see how postflop EV changes: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
