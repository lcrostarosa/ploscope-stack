1. Overvaluing non-nut hands → Prioritize nut potential and redraws
2. Ignoring position → Tighten OOP, widen IP
3. Calling too wide multiway → Respect dominated draws
4. Misreading wrap strength → Count clean outs and redraws
5. Under-bluffing good blockers → Leverage range advantage spots
6. Overplaying weak A-A-x-x → Prefer suits and connectivity
7. Chasing with poor equity realization → Consider turn and river playability
8. Failing to adjust to stack depth → Use SPR to guide commitment
9. Not reviewing hands → Build a feedback loop
10. No study structure → Use drills and tracked goals
