## Why Nut Potential Wins in PLO

Because equities are close and pots go multiway, second-best hands incur large losses. Prefer holdings that can make the nuts across many runouts.

## Practical Filters

- Favor double-suited connectivity
- Deprioritize rainbow/gappy holdings
- Beware of dominated nut draws (e.g., low flushes vs. higher suits)

### Practice

- Compare nut vs. non-nut outcomes on similar boards: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
