## Two Boards, Two Races

You compete on both boards independently—half pot per board. Good hands maintain equity across a wide set of textures.

## Keys to Success

- Coverage: interact strongly with both boards
- Robustness: avoid hands that rely on one fragile draw
- Plan lines that force dominated ranges to fold on at least one board
