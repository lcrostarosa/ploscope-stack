};

## Building a Baseline

- Start from position-based templates
- Emphasize double-suited connectivity and nut potential
- Avoid dominated, gappy rainbows

## Adjusting in Practice

- Tighter tables → open more; looser tables → tighten early positions
- Three-bet vs. players overfolding to 3-bets
- Add/removes combos with poor equity realization OOP

## Exploit Ideas

- Isolate weak limpers with advantaged ranges
- Attack capped ranges from position

### Practice in PLOScope

- Build custom ranges and run equities: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
