  excerpt: 'A simple template to review PLO hands and build a feedback loop.',
};

## The Framework (5 Steps)

1. Context: positions, stacks, tendencies
2. Ranges: yours vs. theirs at each node
3. Board interaction: coverage, nuts, redraws
4. Line selection: alternatives and EV drivers
5. Notes: tag, save, and revisit

### Using PLOScope

- Recreate the spot and compare lines in [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
- Save and organize problem hands for weekly review
