## GTO as a Baseline

GTO gives you resilient lines when opponents adjust well. Use it to avoid being overly exploitable.

## When to Deviate

- Population leaks (e.g., overfolding to turn barrels)
- Specific opponent tendencies (e.g., never bluff-catches river)
- Game conditions (stack depths, rake, bomb pots)

### Use the Tools

- Prototype adjustments and compare equities: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
