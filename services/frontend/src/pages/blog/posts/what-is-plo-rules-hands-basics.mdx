## What is PLO?

Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO) is a poker variant where each player receives four hole cards. You must use exactly two hole cards and exactly three community cards to make your five-card hand.

Key differences from No-Limit Hold'em:

- Four hole cards create more combinations and draws
- Equity edges are smaller; more multiway pots
- Position, board coverage, and nut potential matter more

## Core Rules

- Betting is pot-limited: the maximum raise equals the current pot size
- Streets: preflop, flop, turn, river (like Hold'em)
- Showdown rule: exactly two hole cards + three board cards

## Hand Construction Examples

- With A♠ K♠ Q♦ J♦ on a board of T♠ 9♠ 2♣ 4♠ 2♦, you can make a spade flush using K♠ A♠ and 9♠ 4♠ 2♠ from the board
- On paired boards, boats and quads appear more often than in Hold'em

## Quick Tips

- Favor hands with nut potential and strong redraws
- Be selective out of position; realize equity better in position
- Respect multiway dynamics and avoid dominated draws
