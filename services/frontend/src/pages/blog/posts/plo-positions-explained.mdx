## Positions 101

Late position acts last and realizes equity better. Early position requires tighter selection because you play more multiway and out of position.

- Favor hands that play cleanly OOP (nut potential, strong blockers)
- Exploit capped ranges when you have position postflop

- Model position impact: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
