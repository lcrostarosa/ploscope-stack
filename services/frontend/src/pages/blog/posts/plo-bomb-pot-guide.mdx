## What is a Bomb Pot?

A bomb pot is a special hand where all players post a fixed amount preflop and the table skips straight to the flop. There is no preflop betting round. Action begins on the flop with a prebuilt pot that is often much larger than usual.

Common bomb pot formats:

- Single-board bomb pot: standard one-board runout
- Double-board bomb pot: two separate flops are dealt, then turns and rivers for each board. The final pot is split by the best hand on each board (half of the pot per board).

Why bomb pots are tricky:

- Everyone sees a flop, making equities tighter and multiway dynamics more common
- Positional edges and board coverage matter even more
- On double-board bomb pots, your hand must interact well with a wide set of textures, not just one

## PLO-specific Considerations

Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO) uses four hole cards per player and you must use exactly two hole cards with three community cards to make your final hand. This increases the number of combinations and the range interactions, especially in multiway and two-board scenarios.

Key concepts:

- Board coverage across many textures
- Nut potential vs. dominated draws
- Equity realization in multiway pots
- Hand robustness on two boards (double-board formats)

## How PLOScope Helps

PLOScope is designed to make bomb pot study fast and repeatable:

- Spot Mode: Build multiway spots quickly and simulate equities across players
- Two-board Awareness: Run equity estimates for both boards to understand split and scoop potential
- Spot Mode: Practice decision-making under pressure with configurable opponents and actions
- Hand History Tools: Save and revisit bomb pot scenarios to compare lines and outcomes

### Example Study Workflow

1. Set up a bomb pot spot (single- or double-board) with the number of players you face most often
2. Choose realistic ranges and run simulations to see equity distribution
3. Adjust assumptions (e.g., position, stack depth, opponent tendencies) and compare outcomes
4. Save the spot to build your library of recurring bomb pot situations

By repeatedly analyzing these multiway textures, you will internalize how your hand classes perform and what lines win the most over time.
