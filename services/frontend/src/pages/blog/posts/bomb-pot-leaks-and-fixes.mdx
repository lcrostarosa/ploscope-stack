## Leaks

- Overplaying medium-strength one-board hands
- Ignoring two-board interactions (double-board)
- Calling down with poor visibility out of position
- Not adjusting to table tendencies when everyone sees a flop

## Fixes

- Focus on board coverage and scooping potential
- Respect position; reduce marginal continues OOP
- Use blockers and line planning to pressure capped ranges

### Train It

- Create common bomb pot textures and compare lines: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
- Drill decisions under time constraint: [Spot Mode](/app/spot)
