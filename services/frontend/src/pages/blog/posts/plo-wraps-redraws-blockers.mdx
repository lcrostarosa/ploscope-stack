## Wraps and Redraws

Wraps are straight draws with more than 8 outs; redraws are secondary paths (e.g., backdoor flush, higher straight). In PLO, these drive much of your equity.

## Blockers

Blockers reduce the combinations opponents can have. Use them to select bluffs or to slow down vs. ranges that are less likely to have the nuts.
