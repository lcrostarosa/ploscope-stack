## Drills

1. Single-board nut vs. second-best identification
2. Double-board coverage comparison across similar classes
3. Position flip: IP vs. OOP outcomes
4. Stack depth changes (SPR 3, 6, 10) and commitment
5. Blocker-driven bluff line vs. passive line
6. Range tighten/loosen vs. different table tendencies
7. Save and review: build a recurring spot library

### Launch a Drill

- Open [Spot Mode](/app/spot), select players/boards, and run simulations
- Track results and iterate weekly
