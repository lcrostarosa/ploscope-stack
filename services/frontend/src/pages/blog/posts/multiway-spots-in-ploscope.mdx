    'Step-by-step workflow to construct accurate multiway simulations for study.',
};

## Workflow

1. Set number of players and positions
2. Assign realistic preflop ranges per seat
3. Choose single or double-board textures
4. Run equities, tweak assumptions, and compare results
5. Save scenarios and revisit for line testing

### Start Here

- Open [Spot Mode](/app/spot) and configure your most common table formations
