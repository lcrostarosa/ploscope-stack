## What is PLO?

Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO) is a popular poker variant where each player is dealt four hole cards. At showdown, you must use exactly two of your hole cards with exactly three community cards to make your final five-card hand.

Unlike No-Limit Hold’em, PLO’s four-card structure creates many more possible combinations and draws. This generally narrows equity gaps and increases the importance of board coverage and position.

## Basic Rules

- Blinds and betting structure are similar to Hold’em, but betting is limited to the size of the pot (Pot-Limit)
- Preflop, flop, turn, and river structure is the same as in Hold’em
- You must use exactly two hole cards and three board cards at showdown

## Core Strategic Ideas

- Prefer hands that make the nuts or strong redraws across many textures
- Value position: acting later lets you control pot size and realize equity
- Avoid dominated holdings that make second-best hands too often
- Think in ranges: how your whole range fares on a texture vs. just one hand

## How PLOScope Helps You Learn Faster

- Spot Mode: Create specific boards and player configurations to test equities
- Two-Board Support: Analyze double-board scenarios (e.g., bomb pots) to understand split vs. scoop outcomes
- Spot Mode: Practice common spots and get rapid feedback on decisions
- Save & Review: Build a library of scenarios you can revisit to compare lines

By simulating realistic spots and iterating frequently, you can quickly build intuition for which hands and lines perform best in common PLO situations.
