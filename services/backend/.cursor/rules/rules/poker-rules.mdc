## 💣 Bomb Pot Format (Double Board)

### Overview
A **bomb pot** skips the preflop betting round entirely:
- Every player **antes** a set amount (e.g., 5 BB).
- All players see the **flop**.
- The game plays out across **two full community boards**.
- Pot-limit betting begins **on the flop**.

---

### Bomb Pot Flow

1. **Ante Phase**
   - All players post the agreed-upon **bomb ante**.
   - No blinds or preflop betting.

2. **Dealing**
   - Each player is dealt **4 (or more) hole cards**.
   - **Two flops**, **two turns**, and **two rivers** are dealt—separately but in sync.

3. **Postflop Action**
   - Betting begins with the first player **left of the button**.
   - Betting rounds follow:
     - Flop → Turn → River
   - Pot-limit structure applies throughout.

4. **Showdown**
   - Players must build a 5-card hand for **each board** using:
     - **Exactly 2 hole cards**
     - **Exactly 3 community cards**
   - The pot is split:
     - **Half** to the winner of **Board 1**
     - **Half** to the winner of **Board 2**
   - One player may **scoop** both halves.

## 🧬 Hole Card Variants

- Most games use **4 hole cards per player** (standard).
- Some bomb pot variants allow **5 or 6 hole cards**.
  - Players **still** must use exactly **2 hole cards** and **3 board cards** per board.

---

## 🧠 Hand Construction

- Players build **separate hands per board**.
- Each hand must use:
  - **2 of your hole cards**
  - **3 cards from the corresponding board**
- Different combinations can be used on each board.

---

## 🧮 All-In & Side Pots

When players are all-in for different stack sizes:
- A **main pot** is created with the smallest all-in bet.
- Additional bets form **side pots** contested by remaining players.

**Resolution Order**:
1. Evaluate main pot first (all eligible players).
2. Then resolve side pots in order, comparing only hands of players still eligible.

Each pot may also be split across two boards.

---

## 🏆 Showdown & Winning

- Best hand on **each board** wins **half the total pot**.
- A player who wins both boards **scoops** the full pot.
- Split pots can divide further when boards tie or side pots exist.

## 📊 Hand Rankings (High-Only)

Pot Limit Omaha uses standard poker hand rankings:

| Rank            | Description                            |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Royal Flush      | A-K-Q-J-T of the same suit             |
| Straight Flush   | Five consecutive suited cards          |
| Four of a Kind   | e.g. J♠ J♦ J♣ J♥ 8♦                    |
| Full House       | e.g. 9♣ 9♦ 9♠ 3♠ 3♣                    |
| Flush            | Any five cards of the same suit        |
| Straight         | Five consecutive cards, any suits      |
| Three of a Kind  | e.g. Q♣ Q♠ Q♦ 7♠ 2♣                    |

### 🎯 Kickers Matter

- Example:
  - A♠ A♥ K♦ T♣ J♠ **beats** A♠ A♥ Q♦ T♣ J♠
  - Because **K > Q**
